Tune Out is a nifty lifehack for the subway. It will alert you when your stop is approaching so that you can focus on reading, napping, gaming, doodling, and daydreaming while you ride.

Estimated arrival times for approaching trains make it easy to visualize how much time you have to catch the next train.

I designed, implemented and released the initial version in 2013. This is a mockup for a future release, but the current version is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tune-out-l-train-subway-nyc/id644130884?mt=8).
